# What are "Muons"?

Muons are electrically charged elementary particles.
- with 207x the mass.

# What is Muon Spectroscopy

Spin polarised muons are channelled into beamlines and collide with material samples.
They are implanted into the sample and decay with an average lifetime of 2.2Î¼s

# Muon Simulations

Main problem in Muon Spectroscopy - where is the implanted muon?
Known the stopping site

The stopping site is influenced by many factors.

But we can use simulations to approximate its location

# Muon Galaxy tools

Muon Galaxy provides a range of tools for simulating Muon science experiments including:
  - approximating the stopping site
  - simulating spin dynamics of muonated structures
